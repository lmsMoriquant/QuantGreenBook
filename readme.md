# QuantGreenBook

This repository is my working notebook for quant interview practice.

It contains solutions to classic “Green Book” style problems — the kind that show up in quant interviews: probability puzzles, game theory setups, combinatorics questions, and reasoning-based brainteasers.

I use this space to think through problems carefully, write down clean solutions, and keep track of patterns that repeat across interviews.

## Why I’m Building This

Quant interviews are rarely about memorizing formulas.  
They are about:

- Thinking step by step
- Comparing outcomes under different scenarios
- Understanding incentives
- Knowing when to work backward
- Explaining reasoning clearly under pressure

This repository is my attempt to train that muscle consistently.

- Conditional probability
- Bayes' theorem
- Expected value puzzles
- Coin and card problems
- Random processes

### Game Theory
- Pirate game (100 coins problem)
- Sequential voting setups
- Backward induction problems
- Strategic elimination reasoning

### Combinatorics
- Counting arguments
- Permutations and combinations
- Derangements
- Matching problems

### Classic Brain Teasers
- 25 horses, find top 3

### Quant Intuition
- Risk vs reward reasoning
- Volatility vs variance intuition
- Sharpe ratio interpretation
- Strategy trade-offs

## How Problems Are Written

For each problem, I try to include:

- The original question
- A clean step-by-step explanation
- The key insight
- What an interviewer is really testing

The goal is clarity — not just getting the answer, but understanding why the logic works.
